## Report Formats

Each package has coverage reports in multiple formats:

1. **HTML Reports**: Open `index.html` in each coverage directory to view interactive reports
2. **Text Reports**: View `*.txt` files for console output with coverage percentages
3. **JSON Reports**: Coverage data in JSON format for programmatic access

## How to View

### HTML Reports (Recommended)

```bash
# Open main package coverage
open coverage-reports/main-coverage/index.html

# Open React package coverage
open coverage-reports/react-coverage/index.html
```

### Command Line

```bash
# View text summary
cat coverage-reports/main-coverage.txt

# View all summaries
cat coverage-reports/*-coverage.txt
```

## Coverage Metrics

The coverage reports include:

- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of executable statements executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches tested
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of source lines executed

## Minimum Coverage Targets

- Main Package: 80%+ recommended
- React Hooks: 70%+ recommended
- CLI Package: 60%+ (many features require interactive testing)
- Web Component: 70%+ recommended

## Continuous Improvement

To improve coverage:

1. Identify uncovered code in HTML reports (highlighted in red)
2. Add tests for critical paths first
3. Focus on edge cases and error handling
4. Ensure all public APIs are tested
